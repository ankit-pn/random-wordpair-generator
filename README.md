### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/ankit-pn/random-wordpair-generator)

## Install

```sh
npm i random-wordpair-generator
```

## Usage

**1. Language learning:** Library could be used as a tool for language learning exercises. For example, learners could be presented with a random word pair (e.g., "cat" and "book"), and then be asked to create a sentence using both words.

**2. Creative writing:** Library could be used as a prompt for creative writing exercises. Writers could be presented with a random word pair (e.g., "moon" and "spoon"), and then be asked to write a story or poem that incorporates both words.

**3. Game development:** Library could be used in the development of word games, such as a game where players have to come up with a word that connects two random word pairs (e.g., "cat" and "book" might lead to the word "library").

**4. Idea generation:** Library could be used as a tool for generating ideas for a variety of purposes, such as brainstorming or problem-solving. For example, a group of colleagues working on a project could be presented with a random word pair (e.g., "coffee" and "map"), and then be asked to brainstorm ideas that relate to both words.




## How to use
